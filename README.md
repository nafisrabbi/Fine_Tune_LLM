## Features

- **Data Preparation**: Preprocess and tokenize custom datasets for fine-tuning.
- **Model Configuration**: Load and customize LLaMA 2 for specific use cases.
- **Fine-Tuning Process**: Train the model using optimized techniques for NLP tasks.
- **Evaluation and Inference**: Test and deploy the fine-tuned model.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed along with the following libraries:

```bash
pip install transformers datasets accelerate torch
```

You will also need a compatible GPU/TPU for efficient fine-tuning.

## Setup and Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   

3. (Optional) Set up a virtual environment for better dependency management:
   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `env\Scripts\activate`
   ```

---

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Fine_tune_Llama_2_On_Custom_Data.ipynb
   ```

2. Follow the instructions in the notebook to:
   - Load and preprocess your dataset.
   - Configure the LLaMA 2 model for fine-tuning.
   - Train and evaluate the model.

3. Save the fine-tuned model for deployment:
   ```python
   model.save_pretrained('./fine_tuned_model')
   tokenizer.save_pretrained('./fine_tuned_model')
   ```
